## 🏗️ How It Works: A Look Under the Hood (Beginner-Friendly)

Curious about the magic behind your personalized trips? Here's a simple breakdown of how our AI Trip Planner brings your dream itinerary to life:

### The Journey of a Trip Plan (Step-by-Step)

1.  **You & the Frontend (React):** You start your adventure on our user-friendly website, powered by React, inputting your dream destination, travel dates, budget, and more.
2.  **Request to the Backend (Node.js/Express):** Your preferences are securely sent to our Express.js backend server via a REST API.
3.  **Backend Meets AI (Gemini API):** The backend cleverly crafts a specific prompt using your input and sends it off to the intelligent Gemini API.
4.  **AI Brainstorming:** Gemini, our advanced AI, processes the prompt and brainstorms a comprehensive, day-by-day travel plan just for you.
5.  **Gemini Responds:** The AI sends back your freshly generated, personalized itinerary.
6.  **Saving & Sending (MongoDB):** The backend saves this unique itinerary to our secure MongoDB database and then sends it back to your browser.
7.  **Displaying Your Dream (React):** The React frontend beautifully displays your new itinerary, allowing you to view, save, or revisit your past adventures anytime.
